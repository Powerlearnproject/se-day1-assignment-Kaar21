Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.Software engineering involves applying engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. Software engineering has enabled the creation of applications and system that are used daily in various industries and have generally made life easier.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages such as C
2. The rise of agile methodologies in the early 2000's
3. The establishmnt of softwaare engineering as a discipline in the 1960's


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements. Collecting and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design. Creating detailed designs of the software and the user interface.
3. Implementation. Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing. Conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment. Releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance. Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. Both waaterfall and agile methodologies need to complete a step inorder to move to the next step. Waterfall is best for projects with well-defined requirements and changes are difficult to implement while Agile is ideal for projects requiring flexibility, ongoing client interaction, and where the final product is expected to evolve over time.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The role of a software developer is to write code and implement software solutions
The role of a quality assuarance engineer is to ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
The role of a project Manager is to oversee the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code such as visual studio code. Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members such as Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Tight deadlines. The best way to beat tight deadlines is to start early and plan properly and follow it.
2. Changing requirements. Keeping good and effective communication will help to avoid missing deadlines due to changes made after the project has already begun.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing. Involves testing individual components or modules of software. There is early bug detection and ensures the works correctly.
2. Integration Testing. Involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems. Helps to detect interface and intergration issues. 
3. System Testing. This is testing the entire software system as a whole. Ensures completeness of the system.
4. Acceptance Testing. Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. This is the final check before release and helps to know if the user will be satisfied with the software.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Prompt engineering helps to avoid vagueness by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: How to bake?
Improved prompt: How to bake a sponge cake using a n oven? This prompt has been made clear and is very specific on what you want.
